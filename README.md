# reactgame

***
I wanted to create a memory card game with SMB3 Power Items using React. 

### Motivation

The goal was to showcase my skills in react by building a basic react app that has multiple components and props. 

### Design

The design of the application uses Bootstrap. It is intentionally designed to be responsive to your device.
